      <description>I said I&amp;rsquo;d continue these posts this year and that&amp;rsquo;s what I plan to do! A sequel to my post on SQL! (My wife thought this was a terrible joke)
Now let&amp;rsquo;s talk about SEGMENTATION!
Segmentation isn&amp;rsquo;t something I found as intuitive as basic SQL. You can generally figure out what a basic SQL statement is going to do before it runs. Have a look at my last SQL post for an example.</description>

      <description>I had to recall what SQL(Structured Query Language) actually stood for because no one actually calls it &amp;lsquo;Structured Query Language&amp;rsquo;. People just refer to it as &amp;lsquo;see-kwel&amp;rsquo; or as my wife calls it a sequel to a movie and that Godfather 2 is the only acceptable kind.
If you have a lot of historic data that you need to access and interrogate regularly then SQL is probably the way to go.</description>
