      <description>I heard this phrase once a few years ago in a job interview and it&amp;rsquo;s stuck with me ever since. The idea is that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to strive for perfection and that creating something good is&amp;hellip;.good enough.
This resonated with me for a while, I believe in most aspects of my life I strived for perfection most likely Everything was either wrong or right, complete or incomplete there was no middle ground.</description>
