We're three weeks into January so guess it's unusual to write a new year post so late into the month. 

However, I recently had a twitter [conversation](https://twitter.com/5hanIslam/status/954145743970988032) with John Mackintosh who is a data analyst for the NHS up in Scotland. If you look at his blog [site](https://www.johnmackintosh.com/) you can see that I based my blog style on his. Long story short, John encouraged me to write more so that's what I plan to do

I started this blog last year as I was enamoured by all the blogs I was reading online and wanted to get involved! 

I didn't post as much as I'd liked in 2017(4 overall) but I will say I really enjoyed my [post](http://shan-data-science.co.uk/2017-10-23-G1_Climax/) on Japanese wrestling a few months ago. Hopefully I can do more this year!

Here are my goals for 2018:

- Finish writing the last 3 parts of my SQL posts
- Write at least 10 posts this year
- Complete the data science specialisation on Coursera (Currently completed 3 out of 9 modules)
- Move my site from beautiful Jekyll to Blogdown with a new theme!
- Add Mail Chimp Subscription to my blog

Thanks for reading, till the next post!
